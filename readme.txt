Use the LSX Team plugin to show your website visitors the faces and names behind the business, and tell them about yourself and your team members.
 
== Description ==

The [LSX Team plugin](https://lsdev.biz/lsx/extensions/team/) adds a Team post type to your website for adding staff members or creating profiles for people on your website.  You can add a bio, contact details, job information, location, and social handles for each Team Member.  

People like to see a face behind a business, it gives you a more personal, approachable relationship with your users. 

The LSX Team plugin integrates with LSX Testimonials and LSX Projects if you are using these plugins. Linking a Team Member to a project or testimonial can be a simple solution for showing your potential customers your portfolio of work.

Use the [LSX Blocks plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lsx-blocks/) to get a Team block for building your pages more easily. Control the layout of your team posts in the block settings.

= Free Companion Theme = 

LSX Team is built to show off the best of the WordPress block editor, but it requires the free LSX theme in the WordPress theme repository as the perfect companion for LSX Blocks - https://wordpress.org/themes/lsx/

= Works with the LSX Theme == Block Editor Support = 

The LSX theme is full compatible with the WordPress block editor. This means you can now make use of the drag-and-drop page builder when creating new pages and posts. 

[LSX Blocks](https://lsdev.biz/lsx/extensions/blocks) is an extension with blocks designed to display perfectly with the LSX theme. The blocks plugin extends various WordPress core blocks to be more flexible with the WordPress theme. 

The combination of LSX Theme & LSX Blocks gives you a true page builder experience using the WordPress Gutenberg block editor.
